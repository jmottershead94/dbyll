Code Journey
============

Code Journey: [found here](https://jmottershead94.github.io/)

### What is Code Journey?
Code Journey is my attempt at keeping up with a programming style blog where I will rant about my projects and programming techniques that I have used so far that I think are cool.


### Who is Code Journey for?
People who are curious about programming and more specifically games development. Thanks for looking by the way! It means a lot.


### How did you set this up?
When a friend of mine first told me about GitHub pages, we then started looking into different themes and he showed me a list of repositories with great looking themes to choose from. For my site, I chose a brilliant open source GitHub pages theme detailed below: dbyll.


### Sounds "interesting" I guess, where can I find any more of your work?
Again, thanks for reading through this and having a look through - it means a lot! In terms of my work and having a showcase, you can find my stuff here:
- [Portfolio Website](http://jasonmottershead.wixsite.com/portfolio)
- [YouTube Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzOuH-fkkfqSA9Bp3zhFdsQ)


### Future Plans
These will be a bit delayed at the moment (side projects on going, job applications, university coursework and life in general), but here is what I plan to include:
- Adding honours screenshots and any recorded videos.
- Updating with information about my side projects.
- Posts about my learning experience for cool games programming design patterns.
