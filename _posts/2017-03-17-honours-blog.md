description: Timed level creation, finializing questionnaires and acquiring testers.
---

This past week focused on setting up ways to gain data from this project and consequently creating content for Section 4 and 5 of the dissertation. 

The levels for Speedster Gunslinger were built up using both the VR editor as well as the standard editor, and the process for creating these levels was recorded and will be posted on YouTube sometime soon (after testing). Initially, there are some rather interesting results based on these times so far, but this is before a fair assessment has been made and other outside factors have been included.

The VR levels were then added to the build using the current pipeline for loading VR levels into the standard editor (using Unity build settings for an executable). Which involves a little bit of set up starting from a blank new scene in Unity, but has been tested for the 3 levels and the steps recorded always import the level correctly.

On top of this, the questionnaires for testers were drafted and then finialized for testing in the next week. There is a 6 point scale for statements that will obtain the data necessary for the project, as well as some closed questions to help identify key points of research.

Finally, testers have been acquired in order to test the application out. 10 testers overall which is as much as I could get for the time frame provided. This is taking into account booking time for the VR lab and the VR lab is a restricted resource and is shared amongst other university students, so time booked for the lab is precious and must not be wasted. This also means however, that the times for testers to test out the application are not as flexible as the times depend on who else has the Hive booked for VR time, and then if testers can also make that time.
