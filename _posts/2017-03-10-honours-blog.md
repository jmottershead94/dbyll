description: Developed an example game to help showcase the VR tool - Speedster Gunslinger.
---

In order to test this project out I needed to develop a simple game alongside the basic tool. This would allow me to test if users can detect VR created levels from standard created levels, and to also see if VR created content affects the player's gaming experience in anyway.

In terms of the type of game that I have developed, this is a simple FPS game based mainly on slow motion gameplay. The whole premise being that the player is a very fast gunslinger, and can therefore move faster than everyone and everything around them. There are 6 levels in total, 3 created using the standard editor, and another 3 created using the VR editor.

An FPS game was chosen to develop because a first person perspective is really the most suitable type of camera to have for VR games without providing too much confusion for the player. This also allows to keep in line with the natural control scheme for the game, and provide one to one movement for the player which makes learning the controls much easier. The player has their camera control by their head movement, they have a gun in the right hand controller (this is using the HTC Vive hand controllers) and move using the left hand controller. The player has to make their way through 6 levels by eliminating all of the enemies in the level.

In order to try and combat any motion sickness that may occur, precautions have been taken where necessary. The slow gameplay was implemented to try and help users feel like they have more control over their character without having to dodge extremely fast bullets coming towards them with difficulty. Testers will be seated whilst they play the game in order to provide them with a solid reference point for their bodies in the real world and to help with orientation wherever possible. There is a 30 second delay at the start of each level where players will be idle to help them orient themselves to the new level and to offer a chance of having a break from constant action gameplay and moving around.
