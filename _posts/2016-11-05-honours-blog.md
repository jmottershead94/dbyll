description: Making my way through proposal drafts.

Tonight I completed the fifth overall draft of my proposal for this project, which involved converting the google document to a word document and placing it into the mandatory template provided on blackboard. References have been cited as shown in the template as well as figures, currently, this version is just slightly over the word count, but two paragraphs have been highlighted to note sections that are considered weak for the project and could be removed. This however, is waiting for my friend to review before I fully decide on removing sections of the proposal.
