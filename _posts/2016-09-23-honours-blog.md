Having thought about ways to expand upon the calibration tool, it was clear that the calibration tool alone in Unreal 4 would not be enough work for a games programming honours project - and talking with a second year CGT whilst working on a side project: The Apprentice Herbalist, we discussed ideas and ended up talking about a level editor within Virtual Reality - which led me to the idea of a Virtual Reality game engine.

This sounds ambitious, but my initial thoughts are that I will not make this engine from the ground up, more make a UI and other functionality, on top of Unreal 4 so that I can develop this proof of concept and provide a feasibility demo in time. So instead of making a level within the Unreal Editor, the user would place on the headset and be able to edit a level in the application itself. There would be a VR HUD with a more similar set up to the Unity game engine, where the user can add/remove components to a game object and they will see them appear in real time next to them.

For concept, all elements that are able to be generated in the VR will either be pre-defined (so a specific enemy script and character could already be created, the user can choose to add/remove them, and modify speed/damage perhaps), I will need to look into adding scripts/components to objects at runtime (Unity can do it, so I assume Unreal 4 can - further research required). 

I would have a main menu, initial thoughts are that there would be two buttons, one button will take you to a game that I would create using only the VR assets, to prove that it is possible, then a button to take the user to a blank level, where they can start to create their own "game"/level and see what they can do and what they think of the VR HUD for game development.
