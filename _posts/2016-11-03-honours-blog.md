description: Another meeting discussing honours proposals.

For this meeting, we discussed the progress we had made with our proposals, and I presented my first draft to Matthew Bett to look over, which he said would provide some feedback to iterate on.

After the meeting I worked more on my proposal adding more relevant references to the literature review section, and included a reference to talk more about my research method of choice (a questionnaire).
