description: Testers provided data and played the game.

This week involved testers coming in to test out the Speedster Gunslinger game for my honours project - which safe to say was a rather anxious week.

Overall the testing was positive and provided the much needed data for this project, and just a quick special thank you to all of the testers that took the time to play the game. This involved players making their way through 6 levels of the Speedster Gunslinger game, and then filling out a questionnaire at the end on their thoughts on VR development and the gameplay they experienced.

These results will be processed in the next week and the dissertation will be updated as well to reflect these results.
