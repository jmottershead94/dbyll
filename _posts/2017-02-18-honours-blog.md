description: Developed some more 3D menu goodness.
---

During the end of January and over February so far, I have been working on expanding the functionality of the 3D menu in the application. Users can now implement prefabs that they have created and save / load them to the level. The levels created in VR can now also be loaded into a new scene during edit time, so if the user wanted to make a level during the VR experience, and then export that level into a new scene they can do. The end idea for this project would be to make a unity asset package, which just adds it's own files to the project. Now I am looking to refine object placement, make a scrollable view, and refine the VR experience a bit more (times booked around 27th and 28th Feb).
