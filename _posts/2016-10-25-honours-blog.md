description: How the initial meeting went with the supervisor!
---

Today Matthew Bett - my supervisor - had emailed his students to come into the university to meet up and discuss initial progress and ideas and see if they were feasible and offered advice. on the ideas. He described how VR applications make use of the stereoscopic 3D effect, and that my idea of researching a VR level editor would be hard to pinpoint the research question.

An idea discussed was having a set of tasks for the users to complete in Unity using the interface I have created, and have the users complete these tasks in the normal Unity editor, and then have them complete the tasks using the VR kit - and then try and compare the two experiences.
