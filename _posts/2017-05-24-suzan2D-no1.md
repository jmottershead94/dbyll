![Suzan2D Overview](https://preview.ibb.co/desR0v/editor_overview.png)

This is an overview of the 2D game engine that I am building up, this shows the editor application running - more specifically the animation editor. As you can see, there are more editors in the works to help the game development process along.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to allow developers to use this application to give them a quick head start in development using C++, SFML and ImGui, along with Lua scripting capabilities and the ability to read JSON files. With the way the application is designed it mainly supports lua scripting, but should be able to support other scripting languages if the developer wanted to extend the scripting class and provide a factory class.

I started working on this because I was working on a game over Christmas to try and learn more about the [components design pattern](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html). This game was set to be a simple 2D platformer using SFML and I was programming my own physics with it, but with the Christmas holidays coming to a close and job hunting under way, I didn't dedicate as much time as I should have for development on that.

I was always thinking I would pick the game back up again after coursework submission, and working on side projects helped me learn more over the last semester of 4th year - with one team creating their own 2D engine. The lead developer for that team, [Charlie Gilles](http://charliegillies.com/), who taught me more about components and how to properly setup a project and comments to an industry standard essentially. He would provide updates about the engine, it was exciting to hear what features he had implemented, and I started to wonder how I would go about implementing engine features myself. Since I have never properly implemented a game engine before, I was keen to see how I would cope with development and if I was able and willing.

I had a 2D game that I wanted to make using SFML, I wanted to make a 2D game engine for SFML games - so I started work on Suzan2D.

This is also good for a portfolio piece to try and gain some form of understanding for the underlying architecture of game engines. I think there is a lot taken for granted with game engines and I believe keeping in tune with and understanding underlying features is good practice.

## Current Features

### Core
* SFML and ImGui integration.
* Editor and application separation.
	```
	#define EDITOR 1	// To use the editor interface.
	```

	```
	#define EDITOR 0	// To play the game.
	```
* Entity-Component system.
* Integrated scripting system (currently using LUA with LuaBridge).

### Animation Editor
* Preview entities.
