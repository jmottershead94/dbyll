Over the Christmas period I was working mainly on job applications and side project work, but I did manage to look a little bit into the dissertation structure and started to look through the example dissertations. Over the starting university weeks, I have worked more on the technical side of the honours project and have recently added more primitives for the user to add, as well as adding a colour picker (I'd like to expand this to a colour wheel, but it seemed hard to implement not using Unity's standard UI elements). Today(26/01/2017), I will be working on the dissertation itself and providing more content in order to keep up the incremental progress.
