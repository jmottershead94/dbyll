description: My development progress for my feasibility demo!

Last week, my supervisor provided some feedback for the risk assessment form I filled out, and noted that I should mention that users should be told that they can leave at anytime and without reason. I sent the answers for my ethics form to my supervisor, and I am waiting for feedback on that, which I will ask about in today's meeting. 

With tasks over the week, I wasn't able to implement VR controls, as I was unable to book the correct days in order to use the VR setup, so this task has rolled over to next week. I managed to implement a basic 3D menu and manipulation of game objects in the game with mouse and keyboard controls (I need access to the VR hardware to transfer this to VR input), but the logic is all setup.

Last week was spent mainly working on external projects, but time was made for the feasibility demo where possible. The UI is very basic but functional, and needs polishing up in order to satisfy the standard of work I hope to aim for. 

Next week and the week after will all be spent on developing the feasibility demo more, and fleshing out the UI and making sure it is smooth and comfortable to look at. If time permits before the deadline, I will look into making this a Unity plugin before the Christmas break - this is the end goal for this project as well as the research results.
