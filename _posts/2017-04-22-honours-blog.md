description: 4th Year submissions are complete!

Finally, all 4th year coursework has been submitted and now my final year grades and degree classification are into the hands of the lecturers.

I mainly worked on the feedback my supervisor provided for my dissertation and have started to pickup on side project work again.

For the disseration I reworked the opening sentence for my introduction, found more references for the background section, and restructured the methodology to talk more in respect to the experiments later. Some interesting papers talking about Gamifcation and VR Simulations.

These papers helped to support my project by providing an insight into the benefits of using VR and how the gamification of tasks can help keep users engaged. Since the tool is essentially a mini game in itself in terms of creating content, then there is the pipeline to bring VR levels into the build, then finally, the VR FPS game itself.

Since VR is definitely increasing in popularity, it will be interesting to see where and how VR takes off from here. With hopefully more VR tools becoming available to developers to help create more immersive VR experiences.
