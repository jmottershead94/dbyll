description: Finally submitting the demo!
---

During this final university week before feasibility demo submissions, I have been polishing up the feasibility demo and setting up documents to help present my project progress since the proposal submission. I managed to implement VR controls and setup a basic VR level editor with translation, rotation and scaling capabilities, as well as level saving and loading. Over 6 hours in the VR lab - 3 hours on 29/11/2016 and another 3 hours on 30/11/2016, and a dozen or so hours outside of university setting up the logic for the application. 

For this demo, I have designed what I am calling the anchor point system, which is demonstrated in a diagram called anchor point diagram in the prototype design documents folder of my submission. With both triggers held down, the left hand controller is used as the origin point for manipulation, and then moving the right hand controller around the left hand controller in 3D space will manipulate the objects in the respective axis.

I have also generated a class diagram to help highlight the structure of my code as it stands, and help provide an overview of the approach I am taking with software design techniques (using delegates, virtual methods, inheritance etc.). Finally, I have also designed the first draft of my questionnaire, which at the moment only asks questions related the the VR tools that I will develop - I will need to ask for feedback from my supervisor and perhaps look into comparison statements with the standard engine.

Next week, as discussed in the last supervisor meeting, demonstrations will take place over Tuesday 06/12/2016. For this demonstration, I am still unsure if I need to book a time slot for the VR lab or if my supervisor will take care of that (I will email him today to clarify). In terms of tasks left, I will need to continuously polish the 3D UI, build up the application functionality (add in an inspector like object to display detailed data and also a way to track existing prefabs) - which will be done over Christmas and next Semester.

Over Christmas, I will make a start on my dissertation and keep building up the literature review.
