Having researched some initial findings and resources for a game engine and VR separately, I remembered back in 2nd year reading a book that was recommended by one of the lecturers called Game Engine Architecture. So I now have access to an ebook of this, and also found a pdf (more based on the theory, description and history) about VR. 

Today I also found a very short paper in the Abertay summon collection which looked directly and combining both Unreal 4 and the Unity game engine to help teach game development. Which is useful because I will now be able to see what other people pick up as useful tools from Unreal 4 and Unity.
