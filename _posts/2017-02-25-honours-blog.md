description: Summarising the week of progress.

Drawing closer to the end of February I have been mainly working on side projects this week (two of which are planning on entering for Dare Academy), so honours progress has been very slow this week. Over this weekend I am planning on developing object manipulation via holding controls, as well as starting to look into an object placement algorithm (for more precise snapping functionality). The other tasks I set for prefab manipulation and scrollable views are taking too long and are making me lose interest somewhat, but object manipulation through drag controls and object snapping has peaked my interest more. Therefore I plan to work towards them for now, and offer prefab manipulation and scrollable views as future work. For prefab manipulation I already have the ability to edit the primitives in the project, so compared to having another object that can have those controls applied to it doesn't seem like a big step up compared to object snapping for instance - which is why I am shifting focus to that.
