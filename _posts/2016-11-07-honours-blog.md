description: Feedback on my proposal work so far.
---

Over the course of this afternoon, my friend Daniel Boyd has thoroughly looked over and read my proposal as it currently stands, and provided feedback for the document. Using Google Docs for the current version, he highlighted sections for me and wrote comments on the sections describing what changes/updates I should do for them, and provided general feedback at the bottom of the document - he also talked through the document with me.

I also received an email from Matt Bett today saying that he looked over my first draft, and he said that everything looked fine and that all the content that he would look for was there - so overall my structure seems to be okay.

I have implemented the changes suggested by Daniel, which only involved tweaks to the document here and there and means that I have kept all of the content from what Matt has seen, and have only really added to the document since he has seen it.
