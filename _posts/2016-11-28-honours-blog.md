description: Closing in on the demo submission!

Over the last week I visited home to help take a break (mainly from the other 5 side projects I am working on), but also from coursework submissions. So the feasibility demo has not made any progress since the last entry, which included a basic 3D menu and UI system, as well as object transform manipulation.

Today, I submitted the online ethics form and I am awaiting approval/feedback on that form. I handed my supervisor my completed risk assessment form last week, and I am still awaiting approval on that form too - which I assume might be provided at tomorrow's meeting (29/11/2016).

This week will involve polishing up the UI to make it look good and comfortable to view in VR, as well as implementing VR controls with the SteamVR plugin.
