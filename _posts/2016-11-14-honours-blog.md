Having submitted the proposal document last week, the next set for this project is looking into the feasibility demo more so, and assessing risks and any ethical issues. I have been looking into and filling out the current risk assessment form, as well as looking into the ethics form, using the lecture slides as guidance and any linked materials.

Currently, I have filled out the risk assessment form and have backup copies in case I need to amend it.The forms have been printed out and will need to be signed by myself, and my supervisor - which I will try to get tomorrow during our supervisor meeting.

Over the course of this week I will be dedicating a lot more time to working on the feasibility demo, and will try to develop a 3D menu for the application, as well as object manipulation. With this menu the user should be able to drag and drop game objects into the scene and manipulate the transforms. Alongside these implementations, I will also book some time with the VR room in university, so that I can and test VR controls and see how the UI looks.
