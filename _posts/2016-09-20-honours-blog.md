description: A small post about how I planned to start off my honours project.
---

For the start of the honours project, I detailed a list over the end of Summer of what subject areas I would be interested in, which ranged from Physics, to Graphics and even Networking. Before the first week of university, on Wednesday 31st August, I met up with Dr Paul Robertson and discussed these initial ideas, and picked up on the fact that I would like to take on a VR project and proposed his own project which was looking into Mixed Reality (MR), 

This would involve placing a real world object into the virtual world and testing the accuracy of the placement, and seeing if users noticed, if this placement affected them in anyway, see if they prefered it etc.

After another meeting on Friday 16th September with Dr Paul Robertson again, he mentioned a more technical side for the project and we talked more about creating a virtual calibration tool - which would allow users to use the HTC Vive hand controllers, to essentially scan in a real world object, and then the game would scale/create an in-game asset based on these measurements. However, at the moment, we are uncertain if this is technical enough to take on as an honours project so in order to decide, I have to look into any programming feasibility within Unreal 4 to see if we can access the data we need from the controllers. Then if it is feasible, we need to see if the project will take longer than a week to complete, if not, I will need to look for a more technical project, or try and expand on this project even further.
